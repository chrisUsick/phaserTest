## Installation
First you need to install Node.js. Gulp is built in Node.js. You can think of Node.js as a scripting shell in some ways (it can do lots more though). [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Next, get the source code of the project. The simplest way is to click the '<p class="octicon octicon-desktop-download"></p> ' button to download the code using Github desktop.

Next you'll install the dependencies of this app. NPM is Node.js's package manager and Bower is a client-side (for browsers) package manager. In the project directory, Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies and run `bower install` to install bower dependencies.
